MAIN IDEA OF OUR FINAL YEAR PROJECT

So basically my Fyp is about Detection of knee osteoarthritis using advance segmentation in radiographic images.
I'm  using machine learning model to train our model on different data sets of xray images.
For this I'm using unet model and also another model resnet we are mutating these two models together and Alhumdulilah I'm getting good results out it. 
For this project I have also created a Web app which is basically for patients to enter the image and get the results 
And also its easy for doctors they don't have to see the xray to tell which part is infected our model will tell you everything.
That's all about my FYP
